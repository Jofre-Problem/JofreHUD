i assume you were curious about these files and found this
this note as well is for remind me the use of this
this is the first folder of another folder of 
"global codes"
in other words,
the main objective is base everything as max as possible

this folder could be named /base/ or /_base/
im not really sure what name could i use

the files are named like this

(controlname)(main)
(controlname)(code#1/#2)
(controlname)(ypos/xpos)
