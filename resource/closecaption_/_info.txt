Because directory manipulations you can put some closecaptions in here

run these commands for each different file you want;
cc_lang "\common"
cc_lang "\default"
cc_lang "\utilities"
cc_lang "\voice"

or magnum_cc_common/default/utilities/voice to also set up captions if they're disabled

to return to the hud's default;
cc_lang "english"

if you want to add a captions file here, make sure that there is a .txt file with the same name
even if the .txt file is completely unrelated and has none of the captions, it needs to be there
the .txt is used to find cc_emit options by tf2, so an actual one would be ideal
