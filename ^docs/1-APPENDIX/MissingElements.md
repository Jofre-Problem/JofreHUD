# Missing Elements

Some elements or files that are loaded are not included in the tf2 files, but are either loaded from the hl2 files or default in code.

## BaseChat.res

BaseChat.res is a file that can be found inside the hl2 files. It, along with chatscheme.res, controls how the chat box looks. Unedited, it contains:
```
"Resource/UI/BaseChat.res"

}
```

## HudDamageIndicator

HudDamageIndicator is an element that appears inside hudlayout.res. It controls the red marker that rotates around the crosshair for a short time whenever you take damage. By default, it looks like this:
```
	HudDamageIndicator
	{

	}
```
It can however be filled with its own values. For example:
```
	HudDamageIndicator
	{
		"fieldName" "HudDamageIndicator"
		"visible" "1"
		"enabled" "1"
		"MinimumWidth" "10"
		"MaximumWidth" "10"
		"StartRadius" "80"
		"EndRadius" "80"
		"MinimumHeight" "50"
		"MaximumHeight" "50"
		"MinimumTime" "1"
		
		// MaximumDamage
		// MaximumTime
		// TravelTime
		// FadeOutPercentage
		// Noise
	}
```
