//old scoreboard+netgraph scripts don't work in the team/class select menus
//only pure "bind tab +showscores" does work
//also old scripts require binding so if someone uses different binds then this isn't ideal to put in a hud u kno
//and also undoes any netgraph you had before opening the scoreboard usually

//well this hijacks +showscores to also bring up netgraph so it still works in team/class menus and doesn't bind and keeps old settings
//its a dumb fix to a dumb problem
//also forces the 3d player model and the fps counter at the top
//uses increments so it shouldn't break your old settings for these

//comment this out if you don't want this
