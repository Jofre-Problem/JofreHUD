echo --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo
echo
echo From /u/Dr_Element:
echo 
echo ent_fire
echo  - allows you to manipulate entities like no tomorrow.
echo  - To use it, you must write the command, specify a target
echo  - (can be !self, !picker, an entity that has a name, etc.)
echo and then specify an optiona parameter and/or delay.
echo 
echo Here's some examples:
echo 
echo ent_fire !self setmodelscale x y
echo  - scales your player model by x after y seconds.
echo 
echo ent_fire !self rollrarespell
echo  - makes you roll for a rare spell. Must have spell book equipped.
echo 
echo In snowplow, you can stop the train by destroying one of the traintrack keypoints with this:
echo ent_fire eotl_track_4 kill (you can do this with any of the tracks)
echo 
echo Opening doors: ent_fire doorname toggle
echo 
echo ent_fire !picker ignite
echo  - Jinxing a friend - just look at him with your crosshair when you execute the command.
echo  - The uses this command has is vast, and i couldn't possibly list up everything in here.
echo  - But it can be used to make an entity do anything it's capable off basically.
echo  - Extremely useful for mapmakers, great fun for everyone else :3
