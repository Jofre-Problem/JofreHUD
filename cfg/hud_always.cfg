//MOVING SPAWN
//Modified version of Chris's moving spawn script. In its current state, his script makes you join a random class and switch back to medic. 
//This makes you lose ubercharge, which is shitty. Also, if you're playing a highlander match, you can't change to a random class.
//This script fixes all that shit!
//What this effectively does it changes your loadout to its second preset, then back to your first.
//In order for this script to work properly, you need to have the same medigun equipped in both preset A and B, at least one different weapon in the loadouts, and
//'automatically respawn after loadout changes' checked in advanced options.
//Tap twice to move spawn.
//Essentially - Preset A has the same syringe gun and medigun as preset B, but preset B has a different bonesaw. When you press the button, it switches your loadout, makes you respawn,
//and moves your spawn up. You press it again to switch back to your normal loadout.
