# Stats List

This contains a list of all files and the count of different 'gotchas' like how much a file uses things like minmode, #base, or if_mvm. Generally things that a hud developer may want to know about the default files, depending on the features they want to support.

## Metrics

* `linecount` refers to the size of the file, in lines.
* `minmode` refers to the number of things that are affected by your hud minmode setting.
* `#base` refers to the number of files loaded by #base.
* `if_mvm` refers to the number of things that have different values when in mvm.
* `if_readymode` refers to the number of things that have different values when in readymode.
* `if_competitive` refers to the number of things that have different values when playing competitive.
